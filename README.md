###  Fun Fact: Game of Thrones Strategist

Iâ€™m a devoted Game of Thrones aficionadoâ€”having binge-watched all eight seasons and pored over George R.R. Martinâ€™s novels to dissect every political maneuver and power play. I analyze Tyrion Lannisterâ€™s deft Council tactics, Daenerysâ€™s logistical gambits across Essos, and the Night Kingâ€™s threat-modeling beyond the Wall.

I debate shifting alliances and siege outcomes with friends over coffee, mapping each plot twist to management theories and risk frameworks.  
**Winter is comingâ€”and so is my next strategic victory.**
