# Karan Kumar

I like tackling problems that look easy but turn out messy. Sometimes that means figuring out how to get an AI to read research papers and actually write usable lab protocols. Sometimes it’s scraping ten years of stock prices to find patterns and try to guess what happens next. Lately, I’ve been working on ways to make tough conversations like asking for a raise or buying a car a little less stressful using real-time AI advice.

### Projects

**[HagglAI](https://github.com/karankumar24/hagglAI)**  
Helps you prepare for tough conversations. Gives clear suggestions while you’re negotiating. Lets you review what happened so you can handle the next one better.  
Made with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Neon Postgres, and a lot of plain language advice.

**[LabAI](https://github.com/karankumar24/pdfProtocols)**  
Takes research papers as PDFs and turns them into step-by-step lab instructions. Checks if the instructions make sense and match what’s in the paper.  
Built with Python, TypeScript, and real-time progress updates.

**[PSX Data Pipeline](https://github.com/karankumar24/fincom-psx-pipeline)**  
Pulls together ten years of stock prices from the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Cleans up messy files, fills in missing data, and tries to spot patterns and predict what comes next.  
Written in Python with pandas, numpy, and some automation.
