# Hi there 👋

I'm **Karan Kumar**, a software developer who works with AI and data.

I like building things that deal with messy, real-world data, whether that's pulling stock prices off the Pakistan Stock Exchange or turning research papers into safe lab protocols using AI.

### About Me

- **Currently building:** [LabOS](https://github.com/karankumar24/pdfProtocols), an AI system that reads research PDFs and generates validated lab safety protocols
- **Ask me about:** Python, C++, APIs, data pipelines, working with LLMs
- **Open to:** Internship and collaboration opportunities

### Projects

- **[PSX Market Data Pipeline](https://github.com/karankumar24/fincom-psx-pipeline)**
  Grabs daily stock price data from the Pakistan Stock Exchange, handles a bunch of different file formats, fills in gaps for missing trading days, and puts it all together into one clean dataset. Written in Python with pandas and CI through GitHub Actions.

- **[LabOS](https://github.com/karankumar24/pdfProtocols)**
  You give it a research paper as a PDF and it generates step-by-step lab protocols, then checks them for safety, comprehension, and alignment with the source material. The backend is Python, the frontend is TypeScript, and the whole thing runs on Docker and Kubernetes with live progress updates over WebSockets.

### A little more about me

I spend a lot of time reading papers on LLMs and AI agents. Most of what I build comes from wondering "what if this actually worked in practice?"
